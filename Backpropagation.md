What is BackPropagation -
-Backporpagation is a fundamental algoerithm for training algorithms
-It is the mechanism by which neural networks learn from the error of their predictions and adjust their weights to improve performance 
-There are basically three steps for Backward propagation
1) Forward pass: in neural networks data flows through the network from input to output layers ad this process is called forward pass
